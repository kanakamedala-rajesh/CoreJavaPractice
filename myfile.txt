The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20
Cricket league in India contested every year by franchise 
teams representing Indian cities. The league, founded by the
 Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) member Lalit Modi in 2007, 
 is scheduled over April and May of every year.[3] The title sponsor of 
 the IPL in 2016 is Vivo Electronics, thus the league is officially known 
 as the Vivo Indian Premier League.

The IPL is the most-attended cricket 
league in the world and ranks sixth 
among all sports leagues.[4] In 2010, 
the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast 
live on YouTube.[5][6] The brand value of IPL was estimated to be US$3.2
billion in 2014.[7] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed

Of the 11 teams to have competed since the league's first season,
 five have won the title at least once. Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super
  Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders have won twice, while Rajasthan Royals 
  and Deccan Chargers have won once. Mumbai Indians are the current champions
